# REFERENCE_PLATFORM_PROFILE_V1

A **snapshot profile** is a conformance contract over an assembled snapshot. It states the
properties a snapshot SHALL satisfy — not an inventory of what any particular build contains.

A **Profiled Normative Platform (PNP)** is what results when a governance surface, a set of
workloads, and optionally a business domain are compiled and assembled against a profile. There are
as many PNPs as there are profiles, and **no platform is minimal by nature** — minimality is
relative to a profile (6a §8).

This is the **reference** profile: the one the reference realization is developed and demonstrated
against. It selects a single-node, unsigned, locally-stored configuration exercising the full
governed path from interaction admission through constructed invocation to executed workflow and
emitted evidence.

**It is not privileged.** No profile is (6a §11). It is not a base that other profiles derive from —
derivation is declared by the deriving profile, naming its base by identity (6a §10), and this
profile makes no claim on profiles that have not named it.

**Superseded.** This profile is superseded by `GOVERNANCE_SURFACE_PROFILE_V0`, which requires no
entry workflow: under it a conformance workload composes like any other domain rather than being a
condition of conformance.

**It is retained because a sealed snapshot claims it.** The `v3` release names this identity in its
manifest, and a profile is resolved by identity when that snapshot is read — so deleting this file
would make a published, DOI-cited release unreadable: *"a claim nobody can read is not a claim"*
(3b SN-7). A superseded profile does not retroactively alter claims discharged under it (SU-10), and
this file is what lets that claim still be evaluated.

Its own predecessor has been deleted — a deliberate act, not supersession, which deletes nothing
(4e §6).

## 1. Profile

snapshot_profile:
  identity: REFERENCE_PLATFORM_PROFILE_V1
  supersedes: null
  superseded_by: GOVERNANCE_SURFACE_PROFILE_V0

  description: >
    The profile the reference realization is developed and demonstrated against. Selects a
    single-node, unsigned, locally-stored configuration and requires the governance artifacts,
    component capabilities, workloads and conformance claims that exercise the full governed
    path end to end. A usable configuration for that purpose, not a floor: minimality is
    relative to a profile (6a §8), and this profile is not privileged (6a §11).

## 2. Claims and their discharge

A claim is a property the snapshot asserts about itself. A claim with no stated discharge is
decorative — each one below names what settles it.

| Claim | Asserts | Discharged by |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL_INDEPENDENCE` | An Operation Identity is stable across wire protocols; no protocol detail reaches workflow semantics. | `transport::INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_OPERATION_IDENTITY_INDEPENDENCE_V0`, `transport::INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_RESULT_CLASS_PROTOCOL_INDEPENDENCE_V0`, `execution_topology::INVARIANT_TOPOLOGY_TRANSPORT_ORTHOGONAL_V0` |
| `COMPILED_INVOCATION_RESOLUTION` | Operation identity resolves to a governed executable target at compile time; nothing is routed at runtime. | `transport::INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_TARGET_EXISTS_V0`, `transport::INVARIANT_TRANSPORT_NO_DYNAMIC_ROUTING_V0` |
| `SNAPSHOT_IMMUTABILITY` | The assembled snapshot is sealed; no behavior enters at execution time that was not present at build time. | `execution_topology::INVARIANT_TOPOLOGY_IMMUTABLE_AFTER_COMPILATION_V0`; manifest `composite_hash` round-trip verification at assembly |
| `DETERMINISTIC_EXECUTION` | The same snapshot and payload always produce the same result and the same graph addresses. | Compiler verify stage (round-trip + determinism check); per-domain `graph_address_hash` stability across recompiles; runtime determinism tests |

---

## 3. Verification status

The profile is checked against `manifest.json` and the compiled projections of an assembled
snapshot. Not every axis is machine-verifiable today.

| Axis | Verifiable now | Against |
|---|---|---|
| `required_governance.artifacts` | Yes | Canonical projection FQDNs |
| `required_governance.artifact_kinds` | Yes, with normalization (§4) | Canonical projection discriminators |
| `required_workloads.entry_workflows` | Yes | Canonical projection FQDNs; manifest domain list |
| `required_claims` | Yes, indirectly | Presence of the discharging invariants above |
| `required_compiler.capabilities` | **No** | — |
| `required_assembler.capabilities` | **No** | — |
| `required_runtime.capabilities` | **No** | — |
| `required_transport.capabilities` | **No** | — |

The manifest records `provenance.source_commits`, `provenance.compiler_versions`, and per-domain
`graph_address_hash`, but **no component declares its capabilities into the snapshot**. Until each
component emits a capability declaration that assembly records in the manifest, the four component
axes are *declared but unverified* — they state intent for a conformance checker that cannot yet
enforce them. Closing this gap is what makes those axes real contract terms rather than commentary.

---

## 4. Known vocabulary discrepancies

Two mismatches a conformance checker must handle rather than assume away.

**Canonical vs compiled kind names.** This profile uses the canonical `artifact_kind` vocabulary.
The compiled projection currently carries legacy short forms for three of them:

| Canonical (used here) | Compiled projection emits |
|---|---|
| `VOCABULARY` | `VOCAB` |
| `SURFACE_CONTRACT` | `SURFACE` |
| `CAPABILITY_TRANSFORM` / `CAPABILITY_SIDE_EFFECT` | `CT` / `CS` |

A checker MUST normalize to canonical form before comparing. The profile does not adopt the legacy
forms — a standard references canonical vocabulary.

**Component capability names are new vocabulary.** Of the capability identifiers above, only
`ingress`, `admission`, and `egress` are grounded in an existing standard (the transport standard's
TI/TE contracts and admission semantics). The compiler, assembler, and runtime capability names are
minted here and have no declared definition elsewhere. They are deliberately named for observable
functions rather than internal stage names, so they remain stable if a component reorganizes
internally — but they are a second vocabulary until each component adopts them.

---

## 5. The declared vocabulary

`declared_vocabulary.kinds` in §1 is the **closed set of artifact kinds admissible under this
profile**. A kind outside it is unregistered and is refused (KV-2).

Three properties follow, and each is a property of *this profile* rather than of the family:

- **Membership is a selection.** No kind is required of a governed system by the standard family
  (KV-9). Another profile may admit a different set and conform equally.
- **The set is closed within this profile's identity.** Admitting a kind is a change to this
  profile's obligations, and therefore a new profile identity (NP-9) — not an edit to this one.
- **Admission is the vocabulary's act.** A domain may propose a kind; it does not create one, and
  holds no private vocabulary (DP-9).

`required_governance.artifact_kinds` is a different statement: those are the kinds a conforming
snapshot's governance artifacts **must exercise**. The declared vocabulary bounds what may exist;
the required kinds state what must be present. A kind may be admissible and absent from a given
build.

**Naming conventions carry no classification.** Where an identifier bears a prefix corresponding to
a kind, the prefix is convention; kind is established by declaration and never derived from a name
(KV-5, MB-6).

## 6. Scope rules

- A profile references **governed identities only** — FQDNs and artifact codes. Never filesystem
  paths, repository names, branch names, or module paths. Those are deployment facts; they change
  independently of conformance, and a profile that encodes them is invalidated by a rename.
- A profile states requirements, never an inventory. A snapshot may contain more than the profile
  requires and still conform.
- Profile scope changes are new versions (`_V0` → `_V1`), never in-place edits.

---

## 7. Version history

- **V1**: Reissued against the namespace rename. Every FQDN this profile pins was re-expressed in
  the post-rename namespace set; the required properties, claims, and capability names are
  unchanged. The rename retired the `fb.constitution` and `fb.topology` composites and split them
  across concern-owned namespaces, so no artifact this profile references carries its former
  namespace. All 35 pinned FQDNs were verified to resolve against the assembled snapshot.
- **V0**: Original baseline, written against the pre-rename namespace set. Retained immutable as
  provenance; its FQDNs no longer resolve and it MUST NOT be used to check a current snapshot.
